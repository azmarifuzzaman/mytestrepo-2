<html>this is index file in repo-2 respository

this line is added from 2nd server in AWS, git-2, to check conflict. After adding this line here, I will push. At this point in my 1st server, git-1, index file will remain same (will not have this portion). at that point, without pulling updated repo, I will do some other change and push to see what happens.

check-1: add another line in this file
check-2: add another file in repo
